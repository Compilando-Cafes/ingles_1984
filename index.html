        George Orwell’s <strong>1984</strong> is a dystopian novel that paints a chilling portrait of a totalitarian
        regime where freedom of thought is forbidden, history is rewritten, and surveillance is absolute. The story
        follows Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the Party, who secretly dreams of rebellion in a world where
        independent thinking is the most dangerous crime of all. As Winston begins to question the system, he is pulled
        into a spiral of fear, deception, and psychological control that forces him to confront the terrifying power of
        the state.
      </p>

        Far from being just a work of fiction, <em>1984</em> is a prophetic warning — a story that resonates even more
        powerfully today as the boundaries between truth and manipulation blur. It's not just a novel: it's a survival
        manual for the mind.

      <h2>About the Author</h2>
      <p>
        George Orwell (1903–1950), born Eric Arthur Blair, was a British novelist, journalist, and political thinker
        best known for his fierce criticism of authoritarianism and his defense of truth and freedom. Having witnessed
        the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe and participated in the Spanish Civil War, Orwell used his
        experiences to craft powerful works that warned against censorship, propaganda, and the erosion of individual
        liberty.

      <p>
        His writing style was clear, direct, and deeply human. Besides <em>1984</em>, Orwell also wrote
        <em>Animal Farm</em>, a satirical allegory that critiques the corruption of revolutionary ideals. Today,
        Orwell’s name is synonymous with political awareness and vigilance: "Orwellian" has become a term used worldwide
        to describe oppressive government practices and manipulation of truth.
