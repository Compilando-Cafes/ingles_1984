      <h2>Book Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1984</strong> is George Orwell’s chilling depiction of a dystopian future where government control has
        reached absolute levels. In this totalitarian society, the Party dictates what is real, rewrites history,
        monitors every citizen, and punishes even unspoken thoughts of rebellion. The protagonist, Winston Smith,
        secretly resists this oppressive regime, but in a world where nothing is private and everything is manipulated,
        rebellion may be futile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through its haunting narrative and prophetic insights, <em>1984</em> presents a terrifying warning: when power
        is unchecked and truth is flexible, freedom becomes impossible. The novel remains a timeless call for vigilance
        and resistance.

      <h2>Why Read 1984 Today?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Because surveillance is no longer fiction:</strong> Smart devices, data collection, and online
          tracking are the modern telescreens.</li>
        <li><strong>Because truth is fragile:</strong> In the age of misinformation, <em>1984</em> shows how facts can
          be manipulated or erased entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Because language shapes reality:</strong> Newspeak isn’t just a plot device — it's a warning about
          how limited language limits thought.</li>
        <li><strong>Because you are not immune:</strong> Reading this book is not just educational — it’s a form of
          resistance.</li>

      <h2>Extended Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Winston Smith works at the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to rewrite historical records to align with the
        Party’s changing version of reality. Outwardly loyal but inwardly tormented, Winston begins to rebel against the
        oppressive system, questioning the world around him and secretly writing in a forbidden diary.
      </p>
      <p>
        His life takes a dramatic turn when he begins an illicit relationship with Julia, a fellow dissenter. Together,
        they attempt to defy the regime and discover the truth behind the lies. However, in a society where even your
        thoughts can betray you, and love is considered a political act, freedom is both dangerous and fleeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Winston descends further into rebellion, he must confront the horrifying mechanisms of control — from the
        relentless surveillance of Big Brother to the psychological torture of Room 101 — and ultimately face the
        question: is it possible to resist a power that controls reality itself?

        <li><strong>Surveillance & Control:</strong> Telescreens, spies, and the Thought Police eliminate privacy and
          enforce conformity.</li>

          thought.</li>
        <li><strong>Reality & Truth:</strong> The Party’s slogan, “Who controls the past controls the future,”
          underscores historical revisionism as a tool of power.</li>
        <li><strong>Resistance & Betrayal:</strong> Winston’s quest for freedom ends in betrayal, highlighting human
          vulnerability under torture.</li>
