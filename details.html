      <h2>Extended Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Winston Smith, a minor member of the ruling Party, lives in Airstrip One (formerly Great Britain). His job at the Ministry of Truth involves rewriting historical records to align with the Party’s shifting narratives. Despite outward conformity, Winston harbors secret doubts and illogical memories of a past before the Party’s dominance.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, Winston purchases a simple paper diary, an act punishable by death. He begins to record his true thoughts—his fears, his memories, and his longing for freedom. When Julia, a fellow worker, passes him a secret love note, Winston realizes he is not alone. Their clandestine romance ignites passion and hope, offering a glimpse of human connection under oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believing they have found an ally in O’Brien, an Inner Party official, Winston and Julia join what they think is an underground resistance. O’Brien provides them with a book that explains the Party’s methods of control: perpetual war, manipulated history, and the axioms of Newspeak. However, this promise of rebellion is a trap. The Thought Police, hidden in trusted offices, arrest them and drag Winston to the Ministry of Love.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, Winston endures brutal torture designed to destroy his sanity and force absolute loyalty to Big Brother. In the notorious Room 101, he is confronted with his worst phobia, breaking his final resistance. The novel closes on a haunting note: Winston, now a hollow shell, sits in a café, genuinely loving and worshipping Big Brother.
